    <h2>Custom Javascript Events experiment (using smokesignals.js)</h2>
    <p>Smokesignals is a convenience javascript library for adding the capability event emitting (event broadcasting on a channel). An item that is converted has methods on, once, off and emit. Using this method provides a convenient abstraction between events and listeners by creating a "communication channel" to attach listeners through.</p>
    <p>In this experiment, the arrow keys emit the name of the arrow key. There are two listeners. Loose coupling between the event and listener allow greater flexibility than a direct relationship between the two.</p>
